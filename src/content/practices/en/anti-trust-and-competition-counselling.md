Anti-trust law is becoming more contentious, and the penalties are becoming potentially huge.

We leverage our expertise and continuous interface with the Kingdom’s General Authority for Competition to advise clients on anti-trust issues that are vital to their businesses.

We help our clients in developing sound risk management strategies and in adopting and implementing strong compliance policies. This includes formulating and updating guidelines and giving staff presentations and training.

Our anti-trust practice covers regulatory, litigation, and investigations work, and we help our clients navigate the Kingdom’s competition regime, as well as counsel clients on the tools to improve their anti-trust compliance programs, including the tools to detect monitor and ensure compliance.
