We offer our clients the possibility to delegate the board secretariat activities of their companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to our Corporate team.

Our team prepares template minutes of the board meetings and shareholders' assembly; ensures the renewal of all registrations (with the Ministry of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce, etc.) and ensures that the bylaws/articles of association of the relevant companies remain up to date with the requirements of the Companies Regulations.

We also provide advice to our clients regarding directors’ rights and duties and ways to mitigate and manage all related liabilities.
