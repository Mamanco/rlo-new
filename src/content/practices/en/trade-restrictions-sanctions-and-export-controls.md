Sanctions and trade restrictions, as well as national security-related and business compliance laws, can result in the imposition of onerous restrictions on businesses. Violations of those regulations can lead to substantial risks, including transactions being unwound, criminal liability, fines, penalties, loss of business, reputational harm, and a variety of associated costs that can be difficult to quantify.

We provide expert advice to our clients on matters of compliance with Saudi Arabian trade restrictions, sanctions and export controls, including regarding:

- the lists of sanctioned persons issued under Royal Order A/44 dated 3/4/1435H
- the Saudi Arabian Boycott Regulation
- the Saudi Arabian Regulation on Combating Terrorist Crimea and its Financing.
