Regulatory changes affect all aspects of the banking and financial services sector. Our finance team has been involved in advising leading international and local financial institutions, corporations and government bodies regarding bank regulatory matters, multi-disciplinary regulatory matters, and helping them navigate the regulatory landscape in demanding market conditions and identify regulatory risks.Â 

Our lawyers win praise for their technical ability as well as their commercial approach, communication and responsiveness and can provide a comprehensive range of services, including advising on bank regulatory matters, ensuring regulatory compliance and identifying regulatory risks.

We have worked closely with and invested time in building relationships with, the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) on drafting the implementing regulations for financial regulations and other regulations related to the integrity and cohesion of the financial sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including those relating to financial leasing, real estate finance and consumer finance controls. Due to the diversity of our client base, we consistently provide commercially relevant, multi-faceted advice in a wide range of sectors.

Our deep understanding and breadth of knowledge of Saudi Arabian regulations give us an advantage when advising a range of clients in relation to banking and finance regulations. We can handle and react to changes to the bank regulatory regime because we have advised on and drafted the very same regulations that our clients are then subject to.

Our banking and finance regulation specialists are an integral part of our finance team. We work seamlessly with our regulatory practice which works on drafting laws and regulations, conducting legal benchmark studies and advising clients on regulatory, governance and commercial matters.
