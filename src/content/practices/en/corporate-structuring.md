In view of the continuing new regulations, we know that structuring your business operations can get complicated. 

This is why we provide bespoke assistance to our clients to put in place the best corporate and commercial structure for their commercial needs taking into account the requirements under Saudi Arabian law.

The strength of our team comes not only from our deep and detailed understanding of Saudi Arabian law but also from our continuous interaction with the relevant authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This allows us to develop cutting-edge structures for our clients.

We advise on a wide range of corporate structuring and restructuring-related projects and specialize in the design and implementation of bespoke, legally compliant corporate structures – however complex and challenging our client’s goals may be.
