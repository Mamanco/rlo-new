We have a broad Public and Administrative Law Dispute practice, our team has successfully represented numerous clients, public or private, before the Board of Grievances or other Saudi Arabian administrative tribunals in complex and sensitive matters.

Our team recognizes how crucial such disputes are for our clients. Therefore, we are committed to resolving such disputes as efficiently and as quickly as possible, offering advice that is both practical and commercial as well as exploring alternative methods (including mediation) to resolve your disputes.

When dealing with public and administrative issues, we also understand the importance for our clients to continue maintaining positive relationships with government bodies. As such, we deal carefully with such matters so that our clients can maintain and develop such relationships even after the dispute has been resolved.
