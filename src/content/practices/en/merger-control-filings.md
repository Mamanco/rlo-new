We handle merger clearances in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for some of the largest transactions locally and internationally. 

Our purpose is to create value for our clients by supporting them on winning regulatory approval of private mergers and acquisitions, public takeovers, joint ventures, cooperation, and disposals.

Our clients turn to us to handle some of the most complex merger clearance filings and rely on our exceptional experience in order to obtain clearance of mergers and acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner. 

Our continuous interface with the Kingdom’s General Authority for Competition translates into practical advice tailored to the specific needs of each client. 

We help our clients navigate the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s competition regime to determine whether a transaction requires notification and prepare and submit pre-merger control and merger control notifications on behalf of our clients. 

Through our work, we are able to draw on our knowledge of novel strategies to deliver value to our clients and minimize the risk in any merger control execution process.
