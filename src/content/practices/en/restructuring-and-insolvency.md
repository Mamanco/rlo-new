Our finance team has been involved in a wide range of complex debt restructurings, refinancing, debt-to-equity swaps, turnarounds, moratoriums and similar transactions advising in sectors including industrial, real estate and others, including where the debt has complex inter-creditor arrangements and various security structures and debtors undergoing bankruptcy procedures under the Bankruptcy Law.

Our lawyers win praise for their technical ability as well as their commercial approach, communication and responsiveness and can provide a comprehensive range of services, including advising on the wide spectrum of innovative restructuring mechanisms, drafting all finance, security and ancillary documentation and successfully achieving the restructuring.

We work closely with administrative agents, banks, financial institutions, chief restructuring officers, bankruptcy trustees, investors, companies, corporate groups, sponsors, directors, accountants and financial advisers to offer innovative restructuring structures and solutions. We also work with governments, investors, public and private sector sponsors and project companies, which allows us to understand the perspective of others in a negotiation.

We offer practical and commercial advice on a range of contentious (together with our litigation specialists) and non-contentious issues that may arise in restructuring or insolvency.

Our team has developed a wide range of restructuring and insolvency workshop materials, which are presented to clients on a regular basis.

Our restructuring and insolvency specialists are an integral part of our finance team allowing us to guide you to a successful restructuring and other solutions. 

We work seamlessly with our regulatory and litigation practices to ensure that our advice and drafting reflect the latest regulatory framework and the latest position taken by the Saudi Arabian courts and committees on the relevant subject, and to ensure that our clients’ interests are protected.
