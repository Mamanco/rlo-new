**Our teamâ€™s familiarity with the licensing and incorporation process of capital market institutions is unparalleled, having worked on the licensing and incorporation of most of the major capital market institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.**

Our team regularly advises local and international companies and investment banks on the licensing and incorporation of Capital Market Institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including capital market institutions that wish to deal in securities (brokerage), arrange securities transactions, hold custody of securities, managing securities, and advising on securities.

Our work includes handling all interactions with the Capital Market Authority (CMA) in relation to the licensing of such capital market institutions, ranging from identifying all requirements for such licensing, assisting with the application and licensing process and the preparation of all constitutional documents required for such incorporation and licensing. Working seamlessly with our top-tier experts in our Corporate practice, we also handle the incorporation process before the Ministry of Commerce and, if required, the foreign investment licensing process with the Ministry of Investment.

Following the incorporation and licensing of the Capital Market Institution, we also advise on general compliance with the relevant regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority, including governance requirements, outsourcing arrangements, periodic reporting, maintenance of client records, fiduciary duties owed to clients, conflict of interests, and risk assessment.

We also advise capital market institutions on merger and acquisition transactions considering the special requirements that apply to such transactions.
