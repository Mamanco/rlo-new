Our team of experienced lawyers advises issuers, underwriters, financial advisors, substantial shareholders and other key participants in equity capital market transactions on the various key requirements and processes that surround an initial public offering transaction. We advise issuers in their contemplated IPOs starting from the IPO assessment until the successful completion and listing of the companyâ€™s shares.

Our team can assist you in conducting IPO assessment and readiness exercise, completing a restructure, carve-out and demerger transactions prior to an IPO, conducting legal due diligence, advise on the recommended steps and help you implement these recommendations, drafting the prospectus, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) submission packages, the Saudi Exchange submission and other regulatory filings, negotiating underwriting and lead manager agreements and other agreements in the context of executing the IPO.

We also acted as an underwriter counsel in many IPOs and have assisted investment banks in structuring their relationship with the issuer, receiving banks and other parties involved.
