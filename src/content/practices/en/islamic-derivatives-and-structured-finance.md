Our Finance team possesses experience in acting for all users of Islamic derivatives products, including derivative providers and end-users, and we have a deep understanding of the issues the clients may face in participating in derivative contacts and the ability to propose measures that take into account relevant requirements under Saudi Arabian law.

Our finance team provides expert advice to clients on a wide range of transactions involving Islamic derivatives advising financiers, banks and government agencies, entities and Islamic derivatives providers such as ISDA/IIFM Tahawwut Master Agreement and Shari’ah-compliant repo agreements. 

Working closely with our capital market and dispute resolution teams we ensure that our advice and drafting reflect the latest position taken by the Saudi Arabian courts and committees on the relevant subject and to account for the commercial litigation and capital market aspects of Islamic derivatives transactions.
