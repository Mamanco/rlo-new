Our team has advised on a vast number of high-profile debt capital market transactions, including those involving Sukuk, bonds, certificates, and other types of debt instruments.Â 

We have advised issuers, dealers, arrangers, underwriters, and other relevant parties in a number of landmark debt capital market transactions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including standalone issuances and debt programs, direct issuances, and issuances through special purpose vehicles. Our team has also been instrumental in sovereign debt offerings, EMTN programs, and equity-linked products.

Our work covers advising our clients on corporate authorizations, disclosures that are required under the regulations of the Capital Market Authority, prospectus drafting and review, preparation of filings to the Capital Market Authority and the Saudi Exchange, drafting the announcements necessary to be made on the Saudi Exchange in the context of a debt capital market transaction.
