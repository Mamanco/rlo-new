Compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) requirements is an important criterion for our clients. 

Based on our strong experience and our deep understanding of EHS Saudi Arabian regulations, we advise our clients on EHS matters both in transactions and on an ad hoc basis. 

This ranges from providing strategic advice to practical guidance over EHS issues.
