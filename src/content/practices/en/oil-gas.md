Oil & Gas continues to be central to the economy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Our Oil & Gas sector group consists of a multi-disciplinary team of experts drawn from our Project, Finance, Corporate and Dispute Resolution practices.

Using our vast expertise in the Oil & Gas industry gained on supporting our clients (private and public) on all aspects of the supply chain and our detailed understanding of Saudi Arabian law, we provide them with cutting-edge, end-to-end solutions which enable them to respond to complex issues on all aspects of the upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation) and downstream (fuels and lubricants, marketing and refining, retail and chemicals) sectors.

Our integrated sector group advises on project development, M&A (public and private), funding (equity, debt and Islamic financing) and litigation.
