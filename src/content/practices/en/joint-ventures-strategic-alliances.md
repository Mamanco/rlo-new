We have substantial experience in advising clients on complex, high-value, strategically important alliances, consortiums, and joint ventures, and has been at the forefront, playing a central role in many of the most significant, industry‑shaping joint ventures and strategic alliances in the recent history of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Our specialized and versatile team’s expertise spans different industries, including energy, transportation and infrastructure, financial institutions, health care, insurance, manufacturing, real estate, retail and hospitality, and technology, media and telecommunications – amongst others.

We can draft, negotiate, and execute complex transaction agreements governed by the rules and regulations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in an efficient way. We can handle and anticipate changes to the regulatory regimes because we advise on the very same rules and regulations that our clients then deal with.
