Vision 2030 has driven transformational changes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia resulting in a vast number of education projects, including public-private partnership projects.

Our Education sector group consists of a multi-disciplinary team of experts drawn from our Project and Corporate practices who support our clients in the complex issues raised by those projects.

We can successfully guide you through all stages of the lifecycle of those projects, including public-private partnerships (both from the point of view of the procurer and the contractor).
