Our restructuring and reorganization practice draws on our lawyers’ experience in handling the most complex and challenging issues and transactions, as well as a deep understanding of the intricacies of the interplay between the different rules and regulations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

Clients benefit from our experience to tackle issues triggered by financial distress or insolvency, receiving complete representation not only from our dedicated restructuring and reorganization team, but also from our well-integrated M&A, finance, corporate, and litigation teams.
