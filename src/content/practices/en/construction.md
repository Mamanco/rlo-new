**Our projects team provides specialist support to clients in the development of procurement strategies and in the analysis and allocation of construction risk.&#160;**

We have extensive experience in the entire range of construction-related projects, from large-scale developments to highly complex multi-plant facilities, in all sectors of the construction industry, including oil & gas, petrochemical, energy, infrastructure and real estate.

We also have extensive experience not only on all the major standard forms of construction contracts (FIDIC’s Red Book, Yellow Book, Silver Book, etc.), but also on bespoke construction contracts used by major Saudi Arabian sponsors like Saudi Aramco and SABIC.  

Because our lawyers regularly draft and amend construction contracts (both Engineering, Procurement and Construction contracts (EPC) and Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management contracts (EPCm)), consultancy agreements (including project management contracts (PMC)), warranties and performance securities – such as bonds and guarantees – to ensure adequate rights of recourse, we are well versed in the construction-related legal issues that our clients are likely to encounter and in the solutions to those risks under Saudi Arabian law.

This experience allows us to structure contracting strategies that fit your requirements regardless of the complexity of the project.

Based on this extensive experience and our detailed understanding of the challenges facing contractors and owners under Saudi Arabian law, our team has developed a wide range of up-to-date memos and workshop materials, including on the application of concepts like “force majeure” to construction contracts under Saudi Arabian law.

Our clients include all types of public and private sector sponsors, developers and contractors, which allows us to understand the perspective of others in a negotiation.

The composition of our team allows us also to blend our specialist skills with a deep understanding of Saudi Arabian legal and business cultures. 

We maintain especially close links with the Litigation Practice team to ensure that our advice and drafting reflect the latest position taken by the Saudi Arabian courts on the relevant subject.
