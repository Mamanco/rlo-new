Corporate governance and compliance are key areas of our practice, where we advise listed companies on minimizing risks relating to their operations and risks that may arise in connection with corporate regulations, including the Companies Law and the Corporate Governance Regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority (CMA).

Our work includes advising listed companies, board of directors, and senior executive management on compliance with board structuring requirements, board independence assessment, shareholdersâ€™ assemblies, liability issues, drafting of corporate governance policies including conflict of interest policy and public disclosures and reporting. We also routinely assist clients with disclosure issues and requirements, and have a deep understating not only of the rules but the practice listed companies follow.

This extensive experience makes us the counsel of choice to many of the listed companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in respect of corporate governance, compliance issues and disclosure advice.
