Further to Vision 2030, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has engaged in numerous public-private partnerships (PPPs).

We are market leaders in providing assistance on Saudi Arabian PPPs. Our precedent is currently used by the Saudi Arabian authorities as a reference for the drafting of future PPP project agreements.

We advise on a wide range of sectors including schools, medical, airports, rail infrastructure, road and bridge infrastructure and housing, bringing to our clients our close experience with the National Centre for Privatization & PPP (“NCP”) gained through our work over the most important PPPs in the Kingdom in the last few years.

We act for sponsors, authorities and contractors. Thanks to the diversity of our client base, we are able to anticipate and understand issues and provide the right cutting-edge solution.
