Our team has been a pioneer in giving a special focus to the significant growth of the fintech industry, including maintaining contact with the Capital Market Authority (CMA) and the Saudi Central Bank as the key regulators of such industry.

We have advised local and international companies on navigating the regulations governing fintech activities, entry into the market of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and developing solutions that meet their business needs.

Our work includes advising clients on the various models that can be utilized and the applicable requirements of the relevant regulator, including models such as equity crowdfunding, robo-advisory, platforms to offer and invest in debt instruments, social trading, intelligent cash management and peer-to-peer lending.

We also advise clients on the process to obtain experimental permits and conditional approvals to test new fintech solutions, including the Saudi Central Bank’s Sandbox and the Capital Market Authority (CMA)’s Fintech Lab, which equips us with strong familiarity with the requirements and processes that clients should follow in testing their new fintech solutions.
