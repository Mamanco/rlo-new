We regularly assist clients in drafting various employment documents such as offer letters, employment contracts, warning letters and undertakings, secondment agreements, mutual termination agreements, notice letters, disciplinary action and termination letters, as well as other employment documentation.

We have also extensive experience in drafting and advising on employee handbooks and policies and obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals for internal policies. Our representation includes drafting and advising on general all-inclusive policies, bonus schemes, detailed policies, grievance procedures, and employee share schemes.
