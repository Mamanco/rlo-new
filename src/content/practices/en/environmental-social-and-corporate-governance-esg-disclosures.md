During the last two decades, awareness has increased amongst companies and market actors that corporate exposure to certain risk factors, such as environmental risks, social practices (including compliance with human rights) and governance issues, can materially affect corporate brand and value and influence investment decisions.

As a result, investors are increasingly demanding public companies to disclose information on ESG-related issues to help them understand and contextualize the nature of those risks to the company’s operations and companies have become more responsive to investors’ demands in that respect.

We deliver unmatched legal expertise in counseling corporate clients on ESG-related issues and its overlap with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s regulatory regime.

We assist our clients in drafting ESG disclosures, including by providing them with up-to-date memoranda on human rights regulations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (including human rights related treaties ratified by the Kingdom).

We also work with our clients to establish appropriate governance procedures and controls to minimize and mitigate ESG-related risks. 

We review and assist our clients with the preparation of ESG and sustainability reports.

Our lawyers bring together in-depth experience in corporate governance and reporting obligations, as well as environmental and other sustainability matters, to counsel clients on developments in ESG-related issues.
