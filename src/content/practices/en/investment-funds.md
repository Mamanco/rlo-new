Our team has substantial experience in the structuring and establishment of investment funds, including through public or private offerings. In particular, our team provides a full-service offering to fund managers and unitholders in relation to their rights and obligations in the context of investment funds.

We advise fund managers and unitholders on the drafting of the terms and conditions of investment funds and their underlying agreements, including framework agreements, management agreements, development agreements and the like. In doing so, we ensure that the fundâ€™s terms and conditions and underlying agreements comply with the relevant regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority (CMA) and best serve the interests of our clients.

Our team also advises fund managers and unitholders on the listing of public investment funds, including the preparation of the required documents composing any applicable filings with the Capital Market Authority and the Saudi Exchange.
