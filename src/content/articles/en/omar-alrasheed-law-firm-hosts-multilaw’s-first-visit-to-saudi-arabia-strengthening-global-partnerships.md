Our firm had the distinct privilege of host Multilaw's first visit and tour of Kingdom, led by CEO Adam Cooke and Chair Jorge Mondragon. Our team took the initiative to schedule meetings between Multilaw and our valued clients, who have benefitted from the expansive network and expertise offered by Multilaw. We also toured Riyadh’s most notable landmarks, giving our guests a glimpse into the rich history and culture of Saudi Arabia. It was an exciting opportunity for us to deepen our partnership with Multilaw and share our country's unique beauty and heritage.
