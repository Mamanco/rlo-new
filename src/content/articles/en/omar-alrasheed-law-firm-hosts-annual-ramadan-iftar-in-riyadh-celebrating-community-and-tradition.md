The Riyadh office recently held its annual Iftar, providing an opportunity for valued clients, partners, and associates to gather and reconnect. The event was a reflection of our commitment to building lasting relationships and celebrating the cultural traditions of Ramadan. We are grateful to all who joined us for this special occasion.
